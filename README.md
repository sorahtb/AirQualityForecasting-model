# AirQualityForecasting-model
Machine Learning Algoritms

A group project in which we developed a project to analyze and predict air quality based on a real dataset from open sources. As part of the project, we performed
data purification and preprocessing, as well as conducted a detailed exploratory analysis using histograms, boxplot charts and scatter plots to identify the
relationships between pollution indicators. This project is the initial one in which we have laid the foundation for further forecasting and analytics.
